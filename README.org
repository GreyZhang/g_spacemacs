** about this repo
- All plugins and configurations are from spacemacs. I keep this because I found install spacemacs usually met a lot of problems. This configuration may be a little old, yet I feel it is stable and powerful engough for me.
** Some configurations by myself

- Use find-file-in-project to replace default function in spacemacs.
- Add benchmark-init which can be used to statistic start time for each package.
